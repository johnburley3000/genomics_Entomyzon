# install treemix: (use v 1.13 Nov2016 because it has important bugfixes, latest version on Odyssey is 1.12, so do local install)

wget https://bitbucket.org/nygcresearch/treemix/downloads/treemix-1.13.tar.gz
tar -xvf treemix-1.13.tar.gz
./configure
-> configure: error: need boost >= 1.42
module load boost/1.50.0-fasrc01
# now ./configure works
make 
make install # permission denied to create regular files in usr/bin/install

- got help from RC to fix this. need to specify the path when doing ./configure, like:
./configure --path=<> (I think this is wrong, but it's something like that.

module load gcc/7.1.0-fasrc01
export PATH=/n/home01/jtb/apps/treemix-1.13/src/
treemix
